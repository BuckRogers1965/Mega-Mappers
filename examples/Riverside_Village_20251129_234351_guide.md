# Riverside Village Guide

## Overview

Riverside Village is a compact, resilient settlement situated at a prime crossing point along a major navigable river. It thrives on river trade, fishing, and the rich farmland surrounding its banks.

**Atmosphere:** The village feels industrious and slightly damp, dominated by the constant sounds of the Wind Mill, the ringing of the smithy, and the shouts of traders down at the dock. While generally peaceful, an underlying tension exists between the older, traditional families (focused on the land) and the newer, more mercantile residents (focused on the river). The architecture is practical—heavy timber frames, thick thatch, and stones pulled from the riverbed.

**History:** Founded centuries ago around an ancient ford, Riverside grew into a critical waypoint for barges and travelers. The presence of two separate houses of worship (Chapel of Mercy and Chapel of the Dawn) and two prominent taverns suggests historical splits, perhaps between merchants and local farmers, that persist subtly today.

**Current Situation:** Trade has been robust, but recent reports of large river eels or other unknown creatures damaging fishing nets have concerned the villagers. Resources are tightly managed, and anyone asking too many questions about the river quickly earns suspicion.

## Key Locations

The village is physically organized, with the Market Square and Well forming the central hub, the docks and mills near the water, and the farms just outside the main cluster of homes.

### The Gathering Places

| Location | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Ye Olde Green Dragon (Inn)** | The premier establishment, cleaner and catering to traveling merchants and wealthier patrons. Run by the reserved, efficient Elara. Known for its strong ale and decent security. |
| **Ye Olde Silver Griffin (Tavern)** | A loud, smoky, and often rowdy tavern frequented by local laborers, farmers, and the less prosperous fishermen. Gossip and low-stakes gambling thrive here. |
| **Market Square** | The paved center of the village, used daily for small-scale produce sales, trading, and announcements. It is rarely fully empty during daylight hours. |
| **Village Well** | Located strategically near the Market Square. The well is deep and reliable, but it is often the site of casual, often whispered, exchanges of news and gossip. |

### Commerce and Craft

| Location | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **William's Smithy** | A sturdy, smoke-stained building where William Copperhand works. Loud and constantly busy, specializing in river tools, hinges, and farm implements. |
| **Wind Mill** | Built on a slight rise overlooking the village. Vital for grinding the grains harvested by the local farms. It operates almost continuously, its massive sails a signature sight. |
| **Emma's Dock** | The main docking area, named for the woman who originally financed its reconstruction. It handles trade barges, small fishing vessels, and the ferry crossing. Often chaotic, overseen by sharp-eyed dockhands. |
| **James's Stables** | A large, well-maintained stable offering livery services for travelers and housing for the draft animals used by the Tom and William farms. James is very protective of his horses. |

### Spiritual Centers

| Location | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Chapel of Mercy (Temple)** | A newer, brightly-lit chapel focused on healing, charity, and mainstream religious worship. Run by cheerful, optimistic clergy who focus on community outreach. |
| **Chapel of the Dawn (Chapel)** | An older, smaller stone chapel dedicated to the rising sun, the harvest, and ancient river spirits. Its services are traditional and somewhat severe. The local farmers primarily attend here. |

### Residential and Farm Properties

| Location | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **John Baker's Cottage & Alice Baker's Cottage** | The residences of the two main bakers in town, often competing over the morning rush at the Market Square. |
| **John Miller's Cottage & Margaret Miller's Cottage** | Residences of the family responsible for the Wind Mill operations. They are influential due to their control over the village's food processing. |
| **Tom Fisher's Cottage** | A small, weather-beaten home near the riverbank belonging to the village’s most experienced (and grumpiest) fisherman. |
| **Alice Thatcher's Cottage, William Cooper's Cottage, Robert Chandler's Cottage** | Homes of essential local tradespeople (roofs, barrels, and candles/soap, respectively). |
| **Wright/Smith Cottages** | **John Smith's Cottage, Alice Wright's Cottage, Sarah Wright's Cottage, Robert Wright's Cottage.** A cluster of dwellings belonging to the extended Wright family (carpenters, wheelwrights) and John Smith (general laborer). |
| **Tom Family Farm** | A large, fertile farmstead specializing in grains and livestock. They are the most traditional of the two main families. |
| **William Family Farm** | Slightly smaller but more modernized, the William farm focuses on specialty crops and intensive livestock rearing, often competing directly with the Tom family. |

## Village Rumors

These are immediate plot hooks and local flavor that can be overheard in the taverns or at the Village Well.

1.  **The Dock Tax Dispute:** "Emma's Dock is technically built on disputed land between the Tom and William farms. Now, the Tom family is claiming the dock hands owe them a tax on every incoming shipment. The docks might shut down unless someone mediates the land boundaries."
2.  **The Wind Mill's Secret Grinding:** "If you listen closely after midnight, the Wind Mill starts turning, even when there's no wind. John Miller and his family swear they lock it up tight every dusk. Someone must be using the old millstones for something they don't want the village to see."
3.  **The Chapel Rivalry:** "The priests at the Chapel of Mercy say the holy relics kept in the Chapel of the Dawn are cursed pagan idols, not religious artifacts. They are secretly trying to raise funds to buy the Dawn property and convert it into a school before the old clergy dies out."
4.  **Missing Livestock:** "Two sheep have gone missing from the William Family Farm in the last week. William swears it’s wolves, but the tracks around the pen look suspiciously like a large, clawed humanoid. The farmers are afraid to hunt it themselves."
5.  **Tom Fisher's Luck Charm:** "Tom Fisher only catches fish when he wears that odd, rusted medallion around his neck. If anyone steals it, his luck will vanish, but perhaps the medallion is tied to the creature that’s been breaking the nets."
6.  **The Chandler's Strange Shipment:** "Robert Chandler (the candle maker) received a massive order last week for specialized, non-smoking tallow candles—hundreds of them. They were picked up by a cloaked figure at James's Stables and carted away quietly before dawn, heading not upstream, but into the old marsh."
7.  **The Silver Griffin's Hidden Room:** "Ye Olde Silver Griffin has a secret basement room used for storing illegal river goods. If you knock on the fifth stone down near the main fireplace, the current owner might panic and expose himself, believing it's the regional tax collector."
