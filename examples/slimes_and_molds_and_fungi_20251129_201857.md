# The Mycoplasm Warrens

**Theme**
This sector of the megadungeon is a festering labyrinth, a vibrant yet repulsive ecosystem dominated by unctuous slimes, aggressive molds, and towering fungi. The air hangs heavy with the scent of damp earth and decay, punctuated by cloying sweet or acrid fumes. Bioluminescent fungi provide sporadic, eerie light, casting long, wavering shadows across walls slick with condensation and viscous residue. This is a place of slow, relentless growth, where organic matter is consumed and repurposed by the fungal and ooze lifeforms that have claimed it. Explorers must contend with corrosive hazards, suffocating spores, adhesive traps, and the amorphous horrors that dwell within the gloom, all while seeking to uncover the purpose of this sector's unusual flourishing or simply to survive its putrid embrace.

## Room Descriptions

**Room ID 1: The Veiled Entry (20x60ft)**
This long, narrow passage appears to be a primary entry point into the sector. The floor is coated in a thin, greasy film that makes it incredibly slippery (DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) or Strength (Athletics) save to avoid slipping and falling prone). Walls are draped with thick, curtain-like growths of *Spore-Veil Fungus*, which release a cloud of mildly irritating spores if disturbed (DC 10 Constitution saving throw or suffer disadvantage on sight-based Perception checks for 1d4 rounds). At the far end, the passage opens into Room 3.

**Room ID 2: The Siphon Trench (60x20ft)**
This chamber serves as a natural runoff for the sector's pervasive dampness. A central trench, 10ft wide and 5ft deep, runs the length of the room, filled with a sluggish, murky green liquid. This liquid is a mild *Corrosive Slime* (1d4 acid damage per round of contact) and is home to several *Ooze Sprouts* (tiny, mobile oozes that attempt to grapple ankles). Small, bioluminescent mushrooms provide dim light. Passages exit to Rooms 3 and 11.

**Room ID 3: The Murky Crossroads (55x30ft)**
A central hub for this part of the sector, this room is damp and smells strongly of mildew. Patches of sickly yellow *Paralysis Mold* cling to the walls and ceiling in random spots. Disturbing a patch (failed DC 13 Wisdom (Perception) check or physical contact) releases a cloud of spores (DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1d4 rounds). Several collapsed crates and ancient equipment, encrusted with a dry, black fungus, are scattered about, suggesting a past attempt to clear this area. Exits lead to Rooms 1, 2, 8, and 10.

**Room ID 5: The Adhesive Corridor (20x60ft)**
This corridor is less damp but more menacing. The floor here is uneven, covered in patches of a sticky, translucent *Amber Slime*. Walking across these patches requires a DC 12 Strength (Athletics) check to avoid becoming grappled (Escape DC 12). Periodically, small, crystalline fungal growths jut from the walls, glowing faintly and humming with a low vibration. These *Resonating Fungi* act as an early warning system, growing brighter and vibrating more intensely if movement is detected within 30ft. Connects to Rooms 8 and 16.

**Room ID 8: The Grotto of Grotesques (45x35ft)**
This cavernous chamber feels naturally formed, with stalagmites and stalactites, many of which are now covered in bizarre, petrified-looking fungal growths. Some resemble grotesque faces or twisted figures. A 15ft diameter pool of dark, viscous fluid occupies the center of the room, slowly bubbling. This *Viscous Mire* is home to 2-3 *Shambling Mounds* (reflavored as sentient fungal masses, CR 5) that lie dormant until disturbed. A partially submerged skeleton lies near the edge of the pool, clutching a tarnished silver locket (perhaps a minor quest item or trinket). Connects to Rooms 3, 5, and 9.

**Room ID 9: The Spore-Trap Antechamber (30x25ft)**
A relatively small, oppressive room. The air here is thick with fine, almost invisible spores. A successful DC 13 Wisdom (Perception) check spots tiny vents in the ceiling and walls. If the pressure plate on the floor (DC 14 Intelligence (Investigation) to spot) is triggered, the vents release a powerful burst of *Suffocating Spores* (DC 14 Constitution saving throw or gain one level of exhaustion and begin suffocating). A single, rusted chest sits against one wall, potentially holding a minor treasure or a red herring. Connects only to Room 8.

**Room ID 10: The Myconid Ring (40x40ft)**
This square chamber is surprisingly well-maintained, almost cultivated. A ring of tall, purple-capped *Myconid Citizens* (friendly NPCs) tends to a garden of glowing fungi in the center. They communicate telepathically, expressing concern over the encroaching slimes from other areas. They might offer information, temporary fungal-based buffs, or trade rare fungal ingredients for help with a specific problem (e.g., clearing a slime patch in a nearby room). Exits lead to Rooms 3 and 12.

**Room ID 11: The Green Slime Gallery (20x35ft)**
A cramped, humid passage. The ceiling here is covered in patches of virulent *Green Slime*. Any disturbance (loud noise, striking the ceiling, or a failed DC 13 Wisdom (Perception) check to notice) causes a patch to drop (DC 12 Dexterity saving throw to avoid; takes 4d10 acid damage, armor corroded). The floor beneath is dotted with the corroded remnants of adventurers' gear, a grim warning. Connects to Room 2 and 12.

**Room ID 12: The Central Mycelial Network (60x45ft)**
This vast chamber serves as the heart of the fungal growth in this sector. Giant, pulsating bioluminescent mycelial strands spiderweb across the ceiling and floor, some as thick as tree trunks, providing dim, shifting light. Pools of clear, nutrient-rich liquid are scattered throughout, which are highly flammable if ignited. A massive, central mushroom (perhaps a *Fungal Sovereign* or powerful *Gas Spore*) dominates the room, slowly exhaling clouds of slightly disorienting spores (DC 10 Wisdom saving throw or suffer disadvantage on Perception checks for 1d4 rounds). This room seems to be the source of much of the fungal life. Exits lead to Rooms 10, 11, 17, and 19.

**Room ID 16: The Slimefall Chasm (60x35ft)**
A precarious chamber with a deep, dark chasm running down the middle. From cracks in the ceiling, a continuous flow of thick, grey *Congealing Slime* drips into the chasm, slowly filling it. A narrow, slippery ledge (DC 14 Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) to traverse) runs along one side. Anyone falling into the chasm will be slowly suffocated and digested by the slime (Disadvantage on Strength checks to escape, 1d6 bludgeoning + 1d6 acid damage per round). An unstable bridge of fungal matter might span the chasm, offering a quicker but riskier crossing. Connects to Rooms 5 and 17.

**Room ID 17: The Ooze Nursery (50x45ft)**
This room is warm and unusually silent, save for the faint squelching sounds. The floor is covered in shallow, iridescent pools of *Gelatinous Protoplasm*, within which dozens of small, nascent oozes (young *Gray Oozes* or *Black Puddings*) are forming. Disturbing the pools will awaken 1d4 mature *Gray Oozes* or *Black Puddings* that lie dormant nearby, disguised as parts of the walls or floor (DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) to spot before they attack). A small, dry island in the center might contain a valuable, intact research journal from a previous expedition. Connects to Rooms 12, 16, and 18.

**Room ID 18: The Fungal Ossuary (20x40ft)**
This long room is filled with the skeletal remains of various creatures, large and small, all fused into a grotesque tapestry by a fast-growing *Bone-Eating Fungus*. The fungus extracts nutrients from calcium, leaving behind brittle, chalky structures. Disturbing the bones might awaken 2-3 *Fungal Zombies* (reflavored zombies, immune to radiant damage) hidden amongst the piles. A particularly large, intact skull might have a valuable gem embedded in it. Connects to Room 17 and 30.

**Room ID 19: The Spore Bloom Cavern (50x50ft)**
This vast, high-ceilinged cavern is breathtakingly beautiful yet deadly. Giant, tree-like fungi, some reaching 30ft tall, dominate the space. Their caps glow with shifting colors, and iridescent spores drift lazily through the air. These *Chromatic Bloom Fungi* are sentient and communicate through vibrant light patterns. While not inherently hostile, they are sensitive. If more than 50% of the room is illuminated by external light sources or if a creature moves too quickly, they release a blinding pulse of spores (DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be Blinded for 1d4 rounds). A hidden niche behind one of the larger fungi might contain a rare alchemical ingredient. Connects to Rooms 12, 20, and 25.

**Room ID 20: The Isolation Vat (25x25ft)**
A small, square chamber with a single, massive vat made of rough, dark stone. The vat is filled with a churning, bioluminescent *Experimental Slime*, which seems to be constantly shifting shape and color. This slime is highly unstable; direct contact causes random magical effects (roll on a wild magic table, or DM's choice). A corroded lever on a pedestal nearby could either drain the vat (revealing a hidden item at the bottom) or release the slime into the surrounding areas (a potential disaster for the sector). Connects only to Room 19.

**Room ID 25: The Moldy Archives (60x35ft)**
Once a storage or archive area, this room is now a tragedy of preservation. Shelves filled with scrolls, books, and tablets line the walls, but nearly all are covered in a pervasive, rapidly growing *Paper-Eating Mold*. Any attempt to salvage items risks spreading the mold and destroying them entirely (DC 15 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) or Intelligence (Investigation) to carefully extract an item without damage). A few perfectly preserved (and highly valuable) texts might be found in a sealed, miraculously overlooked chest hidden beneath a collapsed shelf. Connects to Rooms 19, 26, and 31.

**Room ID 26: The Slime Sculptures (35x45ft)**
This room showcases bizarre "art" created by the slimes. Several humanoid figures, animals, and abstract shapes made entirely of translucent, shimmering *Crystal Slime* stand frozen in place. These are petrified victims or remnants of slimes that absorbed crystalline mineral deposits. Some might be fragile (shattering into small, sharp shards if disturbed), while others might still contain the bones of their victims, visible within the clear slime. One particularly large "sculpture" might hold a valuable magic item, perfectly preserved within its crystalline embrace. Connects to Rooms 25 and 30.

**Room ID 30: The Blackened Gallery (30x60ft)**
This long passage is noticeably hotter and drier than other parts of the sector. The walls and ceiling are scorched black, and the air smells of ozone and burnt fungal matter. Patches of *Brown Mold* (deal 1d6 cold damage to any creature starting its turn within 5ft) are sparsely scattered, suggesting a conflict between fire and ice. An old, charred barricade blocks the far end, hinting at a past attempt to contain something. A small, sturdy chest, miraculously untouched by the scorching, could be hidden behind the barricade. Connects to Rooms 18, 26, and 31.

**Room ID 31: The Fungal Overgrowth (40x60ft)**
A massive, rectangular chamber completely overgrown. The floor is a spongy carpet of various fungi, some bioluminescent, others dark and earthy. Visibility is reduced to 15ft due to the dense fungal stalks (difficult terrain). Hidden within this growth are several *Shriekers* and 1-2 *Violet Fungi*, which are difficult to spot until too late (DC 14 Wisdom (Perception) to spot before triggered). The far wall has collapsed partially, revealing a faint, natural cavern beyond. Connects to Rooms 25, 30, 32, and 37.

**Room ID 32: The Mire of Whispers (55x30ft)**
This room is dominated by a wide, shallow mire of dark, opaque water. Strange, fleshy fungal polyps protrude from the mire, slowly expanding and contracting. As creatures move through the room, the polyps seem to 'whisper' in faint, unsettling voices (DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or suffer disadvantage on Concentration checks for 1d4 rounds due to auditory hallucinations). The whispers are a collective consciousness of the fungi, potentially hinting at deeper secrets of the megadungeon or warning of specific dangers. Wading through the mire is difficult terrain, and 1-2 *Grasping Slimes* (reflavored Gricks without flight, acid damage instead of piercing) might emerge from beneath the water. Connects to Rooms 31 and 34.

**Room ID 34: The Mycotic Garden (45x25ft)**
A controlled environment, showing signs of deliberate cultivation, though now wild. Rows of neatly planted, exotic fungi line the room, some glowing with soft light, others emitting gentle, sweet perfumes. Some of these fungi might be edible (providing temporary buffs like resistance to poison or minor healing), while others are highly toxic (DC 13 Constitution saving throw or suffer 1d6 poison damage and be poisoned for 1 hour). A small, sealed alcove might contain a recipe or a journal detailing the properties of these fungi. Connects to Rooms 32 and 35.

**Room ID 35: The Pressure Pit (35x30ft)**
A small, unassuming room. The floor here is subtly sloped towards a central, circular depression, about 10ft in diameter. This depression is a *Pressure-Sensitive Pit* covered by a thin layer of mold and grime (DC 14 Wisdom (Perception) to spot). If enough weight (e.g., a medium creature) is applied, the floor collapses, dropping creatures into a 20ft deep pit filled with 1d4 *Ochred Jellies* (reflavored Ochre Jellies, with paralyzing touch instead of acid) and patches of Brown Mold. Connects to Rooms 34 and 36.

**Room ID 36: The Bioluminescent Den (45x30ft)**
This room is a maze of bioluminescent tubes and stalks, providing the only source of light. The "tubes" are actually hollow fungal growths that pulse with a soft, warm light. The scent of sweet decay and damp earth is strong. This den is home to a colony of *Fungal Prowlers* (reflavored Stirges, but fungal and drain constitution instead of blood, leaving behind spores) that are camouflaged among the glowing stalks (DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) to spot before they attack). Their nest, a mound of fungal detritus, might contain several small, valuable gems they've collected. Connects to Rooms 35 and 37.

**Room ID 37: The Spore-Choked Passage (25x55ft)**
A long, narrow passage, eerily quiet. The air is thick with a fine, powdery, white substance that covers every surface. This *Sleep Spore Dust* is constantly agitated by subtle air currents. Entering the room requires a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or fall unconscious for 1d4 rounds (waking up if damaged). The dust also obscures vision, imposing disadvantage on Perception checks relying on sight. Patches of harmless, ghostly white fungi line the walls. Connects to Rooms 31.

## Connections
The Mycoplasm Warrens connect to other sectors of the megadungeon through several main arteries and hidden passages:

*   **To the North (potential Sector (58,1))**: A heavily reinforced, slime-coated door in **Room 1 (The Veiled Entry)** appears to lead further into the megadungeon, hinting at a more heavily trafficked, perhaps industrial, area.
*   **To the East (potential Sector (59,0))**: A collapsed, unstable tunnel in **Room 31 (The Fungal Overgrowth)** suggests a connection to a natural cave system or an older, forgotten part of the dungeon, possibly leading to more primordial horrors or ancient secrets.
*   **To the West (potential Sector (57,0))**: A seemingly natural crack in the wall of **Room 37 (The Spore-Choked Passage)**, obscured by dust and growth, might lead to a less-infested, perhaps forgotten, section of the dungeon or a secret escape route.
*   **To the South (potential Sector (58,-1))**: A heavily sealed, iron-bound gate, covered in various molds and warning signs, is found within **Room 19 (The Spore Bloom Cavern)**, implying a quarantine zone or an area deemed too dangerous even for the fungal ecosystem.
