# The Pale Apothecary

**Theme**
The Pale Apothecary sector (0,0) is a former sub-level dedicated to the twisted art of fleshcrafting and intelligent necromancy, overseen by the enigmatic Pale Master before his abrupt demise or ascension. The air is thick with the pervasive, sickening sweetness of embalming fluids mixed with rot and ozone. This sector focuses less on overwhelming hordes and more on psychological dread, failed surgical experiments, and the unnerving realization that many of the undead here are still capable of intelligent malice or retaining fragmented memories of life. Hazards include chemical spills, automated necromantic traps, and unique, high-tier composite undead.

## Room Descriptions

The following rooms are presented in ID order, detailing their function and current state.

### Large Narrative Rooms (Encounters/Objectives)

| Room ID | Size | Description & Contents |
| :---: | :---: | :--- |
| **1** | 55x25ft | **The Morbid Pantry.** A long, cramped storage hall. Floor-to-ceiling shelves hold thousands of stoppered glass jars filled with pale, floating organs—eyes, tongues, and hearts—preserved in cloudy formaldehyde. *Hazard:* A shelf collapses when disturbed, splashing caustic preservation fluids (DC 14 save vs. acid damage). |
| **5** | 40x50ft | **The Dissection Amphitheater.** A large circular room with a stone slab at the center, stained dark with ancient blood and reagents. Tools of horrific surgical precision litter surrounding tables. *Encounter:* A **Flesh Stitcher**, a multi-limbed, intelligent construct tasked with completing the Master's eternal work. |
| **13** | 60x30ft | **The Antechamber of Bone.** The largest entrance hall to the sector. Stone reliefs depicting the painful process of unbinding the soul line the walls. Patrolled by three slow, heavily armored **Crypt Guards** (advanced skeletons). |
| **19** | 40x45ft | **The Archives of Agony.** This humid room contains scrolls and waterlogged books detailing the Master's research into extending undeath through alchemical means. *Loot:* Maps of Sector (0,1) and a recipe for *Virulent Embalming Paste*. *Hazard:* A trapped tome releases a cloud of necrotic spores (DC 15 CON save vs. temporary debility). |
| **24** | 25x60ft | **The Siphon Channels (West).** A narrow, extremely long corridor sloping downward. The floor is covered in a slick, gelatinous grime. The sound of distant rushing liquid echoes constantly. *Environmental Hazard:* Movement speed is halved. |
| **25** | 25x50ft | **The Siphon Channels (East).** Similar to R24, but culminates in a massive iron grate leading into a noxious pit (presumably the dungeon’s waste disposal). *Encounter:* A lurking **Ooze-Wight** formed from discarded organic waste. |
| **26** | 40x50ft | **The Golem Vat.** A square chamber dominated by a cracked, circular stone cistern filled with murky, bubbling fluids. Two large pipes connect this room to R35. *Key Item:* A valve wheel to drain R35. *Encounter:* If the party makes noise, the liquid in the vat begins to stir, revealing the enraged, partially dissolved form of a **Crypt Stalker**. |
| **28** | 60x30ft | **The Mortuary Preparation Bay.** Rows of metal tables where bodies were prepared for ritual binding. *Detail:* Several corpses are laid out, half-finished—some with empty chest cavities, others with mechanical components crudely installed. *Lore:* A journal describes the Master's frustration with a 'failure to retain cognitive function.' |
| **35** | 55x55ft | **The Chamber of Perpetual Binding (Climax).** This enormous, central ritual chamber is the heart of the sector. A glowing circle of runes pulsates on the floor, currently powering a complex, floating undead (perhaps a **Wight Lord** or advanced **Grave Knight**). The room is flooded halfway up the walls with the same thick, corrosive fluid found in R26 (making combat difficult). *Objective:* Shut down the ritual, perhaps by draining the liquid via R26. |
| **38** | 60x45ft | **The Pale Master’s Observation Deck.** An elevated room overlooking the complex plumbing. Filled with monitoring equipment, charts, and chemical distillation apparatus. *Safe Zone:* Relatively clear of direct combatants, but hosts a powerful **Arcane Sentinel** (a magically animated suit of armor). |

### Medium and Small Supporting Rooms

| Room ID | Size | Description & Contents |
| :---: | :---: | :--- |
| **3** | 35x30ft | **Chemical Cellar.** Stacked crates containing rare or volatile reagents (highly flammable). |
| **6** | 20x20ft | **Guard Post.** Small, fortified room now occupied by a single, slumped **Skeleton Archer**. |
| **8** | 20x35ft | **The Scalpel Cabinet.** Dedicated storage for surgical tools. Heavily trapped with needle sprays (Poison trap). |
| **9** | 40x30ft | **The Cold Storage.** A chilled room used to slow decay. Contains meat hooks and several still-fresh corpses tagged for future use. *Minor Encounter:* Two standard **Zombies**. |
| **14** | 30x20ft | **Failed Specimen Cell A.** A barred cell containing the remains of a single creature that was seemingly trying to claw through the stone floor. |
| **15** | 35x20ft | **Failed Specimen Cell B.** Contains rusted restraints and broken alchemical equipment. Smells heavily of copper and sulfur. |
| **16** | 45x20ft | **Quarantine Hallway.** A long, narrow corridor sealed by heavy portcullises at both ends. *Potential Ambush Point.* |
| **17** | 40x30ft | **Triage Area.** A messy staging room with blood-soaked bandages and discarded materials. *Hidden Passage* leading to R19. |
| **20** | 25x35ft | **Maintenance Closet.** Filled with dusty brooms and rusty gears, concealing a frightened, non-combatant **Ghul** hiding from the sector's enforcers. |
| **29** | 20x20ft | **Cellar Store.** Contains barrels of water and weak acids. A safe space for a short rest if secured. |
| **30** | 20x20ft | **Security Override Station.** Contains the mechanism to lock or unlock the portcullises in R16. |
| **33** | 20x35ft | **Dressing Room.** Simple cots and lockers used by the Master's former living apprentices. *Loot:* Minor coins, perhaps a weak healing potion. |
| **34** | 30x45ft | **The Holding Pen.** A room designed to hold victims alive until needed. Currently empty, but the walls bear deep scratch marks and desperate prayers. |

| Exit Direction | Leads To | Description |
| :---: | :---: | :--- |
| **North** | Sector (0,+1) **The Sunken Vaults** | A grand, arching corridor extending from Room 13, leading to chambers dedicated to wealth hoarding. The passage is blocked by a complex runic seal requiring a key or ritual ingredient found in R35 or R19. |
| **East** | Sector (+1,0) **The Foundry of Iron** | A rough, blasted stone tunnel originating in Room 38. The air grows hot and sulfurous, hinting at elemental or mechanical threats ahead. |
| **South** | Sector (0,-1) **The Burrowing Labyrinth** | A vertical shaft descending from Room 25 (past the noxious pit), leading to unstable, earth-filled tunnels and cave systems. Access requires vertical scaling or magic. |
| **West** | Sector (-1,0) **The Hall of Whispers** | A clean, highly polished marble corridor extending from Room 13, suggesting a former administrative or religious area. This exit is heavily guarded by an automated, dormant arcane barrier. |
