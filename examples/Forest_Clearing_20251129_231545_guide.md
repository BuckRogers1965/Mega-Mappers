# Forest Clearing

## Overview

Forest Clearing is a secluded but industrious community carved out of the dense wilderness alongside the winding River Oakhaven. The village operates under a tacit agreement of self-sufficiency; the surrounding forest provides timber, game, and protection, but also enforces a natural isolation.

**Atmosphere:** The air smells perpetually of woodsmoke, wet earth, and fresh-baked bread. The village lacks elaborate defenses, relying instead on its sturdy, thatched homes and the thick woods surrounding the Market Square. While generally peaceful, there is a low-grade tension between the older, more rustic traditions (represented by The Old Griffin) and the newer, more mercantile influences (represented by Ye Olde Silver Griffin and the constant traffic at William's Dock).

**History:** Founded roughly sixty years ago by lumber families fleeing a political upheaval downstream, the settlers chose the clearing because of its fertile soil and proximity to the river. The dual chapels suggest an early schism in belief or a slow assimilation of new residents over time. The "Griffin" legend stems from a massive statue carved from a root ball found during the initial clearing.

**Current Situation:** The harvest has been bountiful, but recent heavy rains have made the river temperamental, complicating trade via the dock. The villagers are hardworking but cautious of strangers, wary of anything that might threaten their delicate balance with the forest.

## Village Rumors

1.  **The Whispering Timber:** (History/Mystery) "They say the massive wood columns holding up The Old Griffin still *weep*. Listen close on a quiet night, and you can hear the voices of the trees the first settlers cut down. Some folks think the forest wants its clearing back."
2.  **The Dock Thief:** (Plot Hook/Suspicion) "Someone has been stealing sacks of flour destined for the Dock *before* they even leave the farms. It’s an inside job, and the James family and the Mary family are already trading accusations, threatening a feud."
3.  **The Patron Saint's Wrath:** (Faith/Conflict) "A hunting party from the Chapel of St. Cuthbert went deep into the woods a week ago and hasn't returned. Father Thomas of the Chapel of Mercy claims it's because they were too greedy; the followers of St. Cuthbert believe something ancient and evil dragged them off."
4.  **The Silver Cache:** (Treasure/Rivalry) "Ask William Miller at the Stone Mill about Ye Olde Silver Griffin. He swears the only way Mary Baker financed that fancy new tavern was by digging up a hidden cache of old silver coins buried by the village's original, forgotten founders."
5.  **The River Hag:** (Monster/Threat) "No one uses William's Dock after sundown. Old Tom Baker claims he saw a creature with long, dripping hair pulling things off the platform and dragging them beneath the surface. It’s why the fish have been biting so poorly lately."
6.  **The Miller's Secret:** (NPC/Blackmail) "William Miller is deeply in debt to a group of men who only visit the clearing via the Dock once a month. If he can’t pay them soon, they plan to take ownership of the Stone Mill and raise prices on all the villagers."
7.  **The Unseen Gardener:** (Weirdness) "Margaret Thatcher’s prized patch of healing nightshade keeps disappearing, bit by bit, overnight. She says she saw tiny, glowing footprints leading from her garden towards the deep woods, but they vanished before the sun rose."
