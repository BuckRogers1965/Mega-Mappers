# Coastal Village

## Overview

The Coastal Village is a settlement carved out of the rocky shoreline, defined entirely by its relationship with the unforgiving sea. The air is perpetually thick with salt, drying seaweed, and the cries of gulls. Buildings are sturdy, built low to the ground with thick thatch or heavy slate to resist the fierce winds that sweep in from the ocean.

**Atmosphere:** Resilient, hardworking, and deeply superstitious. Life here is simple but tough; the people are suspicious of outsiders but intensely loyal to their community.

**History:** Founded over two centuries ago by a small band of refugees and resourceful fishermen. The village boasts a minor history of skirmishes with sea raiders and the occasional leviathan, fostering a sense of shared survival.

**Current Situation:** The village is experiencing a noticeable decline in the daily catch. For the past few weeks, fishing nets have come back almost empty, putting strain on the Tom and William farming families who normally rely on the excess fish market. Furthermore, strange green phosphorescence has been reported near the deep-water channel at night, unnerving the older fishermen.

## Key Locations

| Location Name | Type | Description & Function |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **The Stone Anchor** | Inn | The primary lodging for visitors and officials. It is sturdy, clean, and serves a decent, if bland, stew. Run by the shrewd Margaret Thatcher. |
| **Ye Olde Red Crown** | Tavern | A rough-and-tumble watering hole frequented by the local fishermen. Cheap ale, loud music, and the best place to find genuine village gossip (and perhaps start a brawl). |
| **Chapel of Mercy** | Temple | Dedicated to the gods of healing, safe travel, and charity. It is often used as a rudimentary infirmary. Focuses on peace and compassion. |
| **Chapel of the Dawn** | Chapel | Dedicated to the resilience of the human spirit, the rising sun, and favorable navigation. Favored by the fishermen; its congregation is focused on action and determination. |
| **Market Square** | Market | A humble collection of permanent stalls and open ground near the dock. Smells of fresh bread from John and Mary Baker, fish, and woodsmoke. Trade occurs primarily in the mornings. |
| **Village Well** | Well | The central gathering point for fresh water. A reliable source of clean water and low-key daily gossip among the women fetching water. |
| **Wind Mill** | Mill | Dominates the northern skyline. Essential for grinding grain for the village. Operated primarily by James and Margaret Miller. |
| **Tom's Dock** | Dock | The larger, busier dock. Primarily used by Tom Chandler’s fishing fleet. Usually chaotic with nets, barrels, and the constant smell of brine. |
| **Mary's Smithy** | Smithy | Operated by Sarah Smith. Specializes in rugged ironwork for ships: hooks, anchors, harpoons, and reinforcing bolts. Always loud and smells of coal and burnt metal. |
| **Alice's Stables** | Stable | Well-kept stables that house a few draft horses and provide rental mounts for overland travel. Run efficiently by Alice Smith. |
| **Tom Family Farm** | Farm | Located inland toward the western woods. Focused heavily on root vegetables and sheep. Crucial for feeding the village when the catch is low. |
| **William Family Farm** | Farm | Located north near the windmill. Specializes in grain crops (millet and barley) and is heavily dependent on the Wind Mill. |
| **Cottages** | Residences | The twelve scattered cottages are humble, whitewashed dwellings with sturdy thatched roofs, clustered around the market and services. They house the core working population (Bakers, Chandlers, Millers, Fishers, Coopers, etc.). |

## Village Rumors

1.  **The Sunken Idol:** (Adventure/Mystery) A large fishing vessel belonging to William Fisher snagged something ancient and heavy in the deep channels. They claim it was a stone idol with six eyes, but they dumped it quickly for fear of ill luck. Now, William’s crew is suffering constant misfortune, and the idol is said to lie waiting at the bottom of the bay, poisoning the waters.

2.  **Rivalry of Faiths:** (Social Conflict/Investigation) Father Robert Wright (Chapel of the Dawn) publicly insinuated that the Chapel of Mercy is hoarding funds meant for the village's poor. The priests are now barely speaking, leading to tension at the Market Square. Some believe the Mercy priests are secretly paying off local raiders for protection.

3.  **The Miller’s Secret:** (Local Mystery) James Miller, who runs the Wind Mill, has been secretly grinding grain late at night—far more than the local farms require. Margaret Miller has been seen carrying large, heavy sacks away from the mill path toward the old, abandoned lighthouse north of the village. Locals whisper they are supplying illegal smugglers or perhaps something worse.

4.  **Green Ghost Lights:** (Supernatural Threat) The strange green phosphorescence seen at sea is not merely plankton; it glows in unnatural shapes and patterns. Old Tom Chandler believes it’s the light of a drowned ship's treasure, but younger William Cooper insists it’s the eyes of a massive creature that patrols the coastline, driving the fish away.

5.  **A Thief Among the Fishermen:** (Plot Hook/Theft) A shipment of high-quality ropes and preserved canvas, intended for repair work on Tom’s Dock, was intercepted before it reached the village. Witnesses only reported seeing a swift, small fishing boat sailing unusually fast toward the northern coves, piloted by someone wearing the distinguishing blue wool cap of the Alice Fisher family.

6.  **The Witch of the Well:** (Curse/Minor Magic) Alice Smith, whose Stables are thriving, has been accused by Mary Baker of putting a curse on the Village Well. Mary claims the water has started tasting faintly of sulfur right after Alice started drawing from it for her horses. The villagers are worried this is connected to the failing fish catch.
